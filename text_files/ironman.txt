I feel like you're driving me to a court-martial. This is crazy. What did I do?
I fell like you're gonna pull over and snuff me. You're not allowed to talk? Hey, Forrest.
We can talk, sir.
Oh, I see. So it's personal?
No, you intimidate them.
Good God, you're worman. I honeslty-- I couldn't have called that.
I'd apologize, but isn't that what we're going for here? I thought of you as a soldier first.
I'm an airman.
You have excellent bone structure there. I'm kind of having a hard time not looking at you now. Is that weird?
Come on. It's okay, laugh.
Sir, I have question to ask--
Yes, please. Is it true you went 12 for 12 with last year's Maxim cover models?
That is an excellent question. Yes and no.
March and I had a sceduling confict, but fortunately, the Christmas cover was twins.
Anything else?
You're kidding me with the hand up, right?
Is it cool if I take a picture with you?
Yes, It's very cool.
I don't wanna see this on your MySpace page. Please, no gang signs.
No, throw it up. I'm kidding.
