This is crazy.
What did I do?
You're not allowed to talk?
Hey, Forrest.
So it's personal?
I honestly-- I couldn't have called that.
I thought of you as a soldier first.
I'm kind of having a hard time not looking at you now.
Is that weird?
It's okay, laugh.
Yes and no.
It's very cool.
Please, no gang signs.
I'm kidding.
